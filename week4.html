                <p>In this exercise we were tasked to draw a logo using p5. After experimenting with a bunch of the draw functions provided in p5.js, I settled on using the arc function, which enabled me to create incomplete circles. I messed around the values, as well as incorporating some other functions such as translate and rotate to create this simple logo.</p>
